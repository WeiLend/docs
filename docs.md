### The  Bounty
The bounty WeiFund was build for originally.

https://forum.ethereum.org/discussion/1779/bounty-crowdfunding-dapp#latest

Nick Dodson (thenickdodson@gmail.com) won the bounty with his WeiFund's code. Thereafter, it came M. Terzi's (ma.terzi@tiscali.it) to replicate the underlying mechanics of WeiFund, and build a decentralized crowdlending system called WeiLend. 

The only difference between crowdfunding and crowdlending is in the nature of the money contributed to the projects. 

In crowdfunding, the money is contributed as equity: it shares upsides and downsides of the project and bears a higher risk of not being returned to the original funder. 

In crowdlending, the money is contributed as unsecured loan: it does not participate to the project's upside, but it is returned back to the funders with a higher likelihood, in periodical installments and it is remunerated at a given interest rate.
