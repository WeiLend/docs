In the past decade, crowd funding has become a force for real and positive change both from within and across the web 2.0 landscape. It has given individuals and communities the opportunity to give to projects that they believe in. At the same time, driven by low interest yields from traditional banking, by the cost of financial intermediation through banks, and by the higher and higher availability of data, peer to peer lending has also sprung up.

With the rise of new decentralized peer-to-peer consensus platforms such as Ethereum, we can realize this cause in a more free, open and secure way. With good design, community driven ideas, open-source technologies, secure decentralized peer-to-peer consensus platforms, and the mindset that everyone should have equal and unencumbered access to p2p lending utilities, without the burden of unnecessary paticipation fees; WeiLend hopes to materialize, at the very least, a part of this new and unexplored p2p lending vision.
