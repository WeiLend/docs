In the past decade, crowd funding has become a force for real and positive change both from within and across the web 2.0 landscape. It has given individuals and communities the opportunity to give to projects that they believe in. With the rise of new decentralized peer-to-peer consensus platforms such as Ethereum, we can realize this cause in a more free, open and secure way. With good design, community driven ideas, open-source technologies, secure decentralized peer-to-peer consensus platforms, and the mindset that everyone should have equal and unencumbered access to crowd funding utilities, without the burden of unnecessary paticipation fees; WeiFund hopes to materialize, at the very least, a part of this new and unexplored crowdfunding vision.
